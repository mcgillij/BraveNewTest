Test for Brave New World

## index.html
This file contains the work done for the resize / 3d cube and the mobile redirect

The resizing of the video is being done with stylesheets / div wrapper.

3D Cube was created using three.js / CSS3DRenderer / TrackballControls to get the 3d cube working with the vimeo js api.

## mobile.html
Contains the code for the mobile accelerometer tilt/bouncy 
using very basic js calls to move the title of the video around that was fetched via the vimeo js api.

## login.html
Contains the code for the facebook iRate friendship rating app.

As I never used facebook in the past, this was interesting, as I have privacy concerns with the implications of using it at all. But I made an account and signed up for the developer api, read through the docs and created this very basic friend rating application.

You can use the test user: wjaourt_wongsen_1477231539@tfbnw.net, password:Test12
To access the application that reads his other friends that are loaded up as test users.

I used localforage.js for the persistent storage on the client end.
